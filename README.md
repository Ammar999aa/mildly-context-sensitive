### MILDLY-CONTEXT-SENSITIVE

To use FSA's, CGF's, and beyond context free models as tools in a program where, by setting some variables, one can create a full constructed language that operates based on such rules. This means that those machines will work together to create the exhaustive aspects of a language that acts as similarly as possible to natural languages.
